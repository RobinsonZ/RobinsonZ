I write software (and occasionally words) to help people accomplish their goals, avoid tedium, and learn something new about the world we inhabit and the systems we use. I have a particular interest in human-computer interaction, embedded systems, efficient infrastructure, and cross-disciplinary integration. Read more about me on [my website](https://robinsonz.me).

I'm currently on the Infrastructure team at [Arcesium](https://www.arcesium.com/). We provide advanced data, operations, and analytics software to the financial services industry.
